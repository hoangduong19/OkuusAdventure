# Okuu's Adventure🚀🐦
### 🐦A Remake of Dong Nguyen's banger in 2013🐦
🚀 Welcome to My SDL C++ Project! As known as my UET assignment about coding Game 🚀
![design](https://github.com/hoangduong19/OkuusAdventure/assets/160806540/10c8f30c-4c45-4db3-ab1c-a2e05a79b192)
## 🎉Introduction
Using SDL2 library as main tool to develop, my remake of the classic game, Flappy Bird, brings back the beloved gameplay with a new fresh look and feel. In this game, instead of the original bird, you 'll control a Bird aka Okuu has an ability to explode anything see want! Certainly, it's NUCLEAR power! You'll guide her through a world filled with green pipes. The goal? Simple! Navigate through the gaps in the pipes, aim for the high score, and don't touch anything! It's a test of patience, precision, and perseverance.
## 🎮Gameplay🎮
The controls are as simple as the original. But, there are some new features in my game comparing with Dong Nguyen's game:
-  Press SPACE to make the bird flap.
-  Press R to restart level when the bird die.
-  Press S to use explosion skill. ( It takes 15 seconds to regain skill after using, a UI image on the left-top will be shown if it's available )
-  When your score is above 10, a shield will be randomly spawned, which helps you preventing from dying for one time.
## 🛠️Installation🛠️
## 📚Features📚
- Using a bunch of libraries: SDL2, SDL_image(for graphics), SDL_ttf(for text), SDL_mixer(for music and sfx).
- Use parallax scrolling effect for infinite background scrolling.
- Mute/Unmute music.
- Animation for buttons and explosion skill.
- Fly and gravity effect for Okuu(the Bird).
- A simple array of pipes and make them move.
- Counting score systems and highscore board.
- <b>ESPECIALLY</b>, Shield System and Explosion Skill.
## 🚀My Future Plan🚀
- Adding more skins for Okuu and maps.
- Adding more powerups like x2Score, make gap height between two pipes bigger.
- Making transition to another map when reaching 50 points.
