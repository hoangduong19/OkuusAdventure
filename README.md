## 🎉Introduction
Using SDL2 library as main tool to develop, my remake of the classic game, Flappy Bird, brings back the beloved gameplay with a new fresh look and feel. In this game, you'll guide a charming little bird through a world filled with green pipes. The goal? Simple! Navigate through the gaps in the pipes, aim for the high score, and don't touch anything! It's a test of patience, precision, and perseverance.
## 🎮Gameplay
The controls are as simple as the original. But, there are some new features in my game comparing with Dong Nguyen's game:
-  Press SPACE to make the bird flap.
-  Press R to restart level when the bird die.
-  Press S to use explosion skill. ( It takes 15 seconds to regain skill after using )
-  When you play above >= 10, a shield will be spawned, which helps you preventing from dying for one time. Overall, life += 1.
