🚀 Welcome to My SDL C++ Project! As known as my UET assignment about coding Game 🚀
![design](https://github.com/hoangduong19/OkuusAdventure/assets/160806540/10c8f30c-4c45-4db3-ab1c-a2e05a79b192)
## 🎉Introduction
Using SDL2 library as main tool to develop, my remake of the classic game, Flappy Bird, brings back the beloved gameplay with a new fresh look and feel. Dive into the world of Okuu’s Adventure, a thrilling remake of the 2013 classic that took the world by storm. Forget everything you knew about the original game’s feathered protagonist, you’re at the helm of Okuu, a bird with the extraordinary power to <b>detonate obstacles</b> at will. It’s not just about flapping through gaps; it’s about mastering the nuclear prowess within.
## 🎮Gameplay🎮
The controls are as simple as the original. But, there are some new features in my game comparing with Dong Nguyen's game:
-  Press <b>SPACE</b> to make the Okuu flap.
-  Press <b>R</b> to revive your Okuu.
-  Press <b>S</b> to make Okuu unleash a cataclysmic explosion. (recharge time: 15 seconds, a UI image on the left-top will be shown if it's available)
-  <b>Score Above 10</b>: Watch for the elusive shield—your one-time protection against a pipe collision.
